# Aura Bloom Journal Authentication System

This document outlines the multi-modal authentication system implemented for the Aura Bloom Therapy journal section.

## Overview

The journal authentication system provides three methods of secure authentication:

1. **Face ID** - A sophisticated facial recognition system with 3D depth scanning visual effects
2. **Fingerprint** - A biometric fingerprint scanner with animated feedback
3. **PIN Code** - A secure numeric PIN entry system with visual feedback

## Components Structure

The authentication system is built with the following components:

- `AuthManager.tsx` - The main controller component that manages all authentication methods
- `FaceIdAuth.tsx` - Implements the Face ID authentication with advanced animations
- `BiometricAuth.tsx` - Handles fingerprint scanning with visual feedback
- `PinAuth.tsx` - Provides a PIN code entry interface with security features
- `AuthSettings.tsx` - Settings panel for configuring authentication preferences

## Authentication Flow

1. When a user accesses the journal section, the `JournalRoutes` wrapper in `App.tsx` checks if authentication is required
2. If required, the `AuthManager` is displayed with options to choose an authentication method
3. The user selects and completes an authentication method
4. Upon successful authentication, the user is granted access to journal content
5. Authentication state is maintained for the current session

## Security Features

- **Zero-knowledge encryption** - Journal entries are protected with client-side encryption
- **Configurable security levels** - Users can choose between standard, high, and maximum security
- **Auto-lock** - Journal automatically locks after a period of inactivity
- **Recovery options** - Email recovery and security questions for account recovery
- **Visual privacy indicators** - Clear visual feedback of security status

## User Settings

Users can configure their authentication preferences in the Settings page:

- Set preferred authentication method
- Enable/disable specific authentication methods
- Configure PIN code
- Set up recovery options
- Select security level

## Implementation Notes

- The authentication system uses browser localStorage to store preferences
- For demonstration purposes, authentication is simulated (no actual biometric processing)
- In a production environment, this would integrate with device biometric APIs
- The system design prioritizes both security and user experience

## UI/UX Design

- **Minimal aesthetics** - Clean, distraction-free interfaces
- **Responsive animations** - Smooth transitions and feedback
- **Intuitive flows** - Clear guidance through authentication process
- **Accessibility** - Multiple authentication options for different user needs
- **Confidence-building** - Design elements that convey security and trustworthiness

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with WebAuthn for FIDO2 passkey support
- Two-factor authentication options
- Encrypted cloud backup of journal entries
- Continuous authentication for added security
